This is a **quick** alternative tutorial on how to use the permission numbers to chmod a file, it’s pretty much simple addition. Below is an infographic pulled from google.



## Examples

![777](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*LxMocEDnBY1OztZqOFd2tw.png)

Currently the file ‘example’ has full permissions of 777 within the user/group/all

![444](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Nce54V4VEIJ456ww-UXWMw.png)

After running the chmod of 444 on the file you can now see that user/group/all has only read permissions rather than read write execute.
