**I'm Ryan** I graduated from The University of Greenwich with a first class degree in Computer Science. Current research topics that peak my interest are big data usage for police efficiency, and how social media data leakage can provide useful information to aid detecting patterns. I'm Currently a Software Engineer at Sky Betting & Gaming, which is totally a dream job.

I'm a large advocate of RSS feeds, they're wonderful aren't they.
